# Comparative Analysis of Diabetic Patients

## Description

This project provides an in-depth analysis of diabetic patients using a dataset to identify trends and derive insights. The goal is to understand patterns related to diabetes and explore the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification. The analysis involves preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis, and applying machine learning techniques to classify diabetic conditions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Statistical and visual exploration of the data.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implementation of the KNN algorithm for classification.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and plots to better interpret the results.

## Dataset

The project uses the `KNN_Dataset.csv` file, which includes features such as glucose levels, BMI, and other relevant attributes for diabetic patients.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy: For numerical computations
  - Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization
  - Scikit-learn: For implementing the KNN model
  - Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis
